# qMRI aging data processing

Some practical information about the processing of the "MPM qMRI aging" dataset.

## Prerequisites

We need to have 

- "clean" versions of [SPM](https://github.com/spm/spm) and [MSPM](https://github.com/LREN-CHUV/MSPM), available from GitHub.

- a [copy of the data](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds005851/versions/1.0.0/download#) directly from OpenNeuro

The path to these 3 folders will be defined in the `crc_qMRIage_defaults` function.
